# Human-Pose-Detection
This project focuses on detecting and estimating human poses using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system identifies key body joints and landmarks to understand human posture and movements in real-time. Applications range from fitness tracking and gesture recognition to workplace safety and human-computer interaction.

Key Features
Pose Estimation: Detection of key points like shoulders, elbows, knees, and more.
Real-Time Detection: Efficiently processes video streams for instant results.
Deep Learning Models: Implementation of cutting-edge algorithms like OpenPose, BlazePose, or MediaPipe.
Multi-Person Support: Handles single or multiple individuals in the frame.
Applications: Fitness analysis, ergonomics, sports coaching, and interactive gaming.
